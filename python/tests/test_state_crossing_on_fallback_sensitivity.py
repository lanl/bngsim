"""A rate law that jumps where the state crosses a threshold, in a run left on
CVODES' difference quotient (issues #938 and #932).

One rate law the analytic sensitivity right-hand side declines, ``kc*max(Aobs,
0.5)``, puts every column of the model on CVODES' internal difference quotient.
That quotient reads the rate law at ``y + σ·s``. Beside a surface the state
crosses, ``y + σ·s`` is on the other branch for any column whose sensitivity
moves the state across it. Where the rate law jumps there, the difference is the
jump over ``σ``: the column takes part of the jump before the crossing, and the
jump applied at the crossing is added to it. dY/dk came back 14.52 for 10.2,
beside a warning that said the columns were wrong. Other models of the same
shape ended in CVODE's no-progress error just short of the crossing.

Such a run is refused now: at the crossing, where it gets there, and where it
stalls short of it. A crossing on literal time is not, and neither is one where
the rate law does not jump: the quotient has nothing to straddle.

Every expected value is a closed form.

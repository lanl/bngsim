// bngsim/include/bngsim/fd_jacobian.hpp -- the one-sided difference-quotient
// step rule for the state Jacobian, and the dense column sweep that applies it.
//
// One rule, one place (issue #523). The steady-state solver differenced its
// Jacobian here since issue #63 and improved the step three times on the way
// (#63, #76, #123); the public Model.jacobian() fallback has to hand back the
// SAME matrix the solver factors, which it can only do by running the same
// loop. So the loop is a template over the RHS callable: steady_state.cpp
// instantiates it on SteadyStateRhs (interpreted or compiled RHS), model.cpp on
// NetworkModel::compute_derivs. The parameter-probe steps stay in
// steady_state.cpp; only kFdEps and the probe helper are shared with them.

// absolute 1.0 was wrong in both directions: a nanomolar model was probed at
// 1 molar, and a model in molecule counts (1e6) was probed at 1e-14 of itself,
// which is cancellation noise rather than a derivative. Scored against the
// analytical Jacobian over 1,066 corpus model-states, this rule beats both the

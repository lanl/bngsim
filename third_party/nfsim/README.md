## Overview

NFsim is a free, open-source, biochemical reaction simulator designed to handle
systems that have a large or even infinite number of possible molecular
interactions or states. NFsim also has advanced and flexible options for
simulating coarse-grained representations of complex nonlinear reaction
mechanisms.

NFsim is ideal for modeling polymerization, aggregation, and cooperative
reactions that cannot be handled with traditional stochastic or ODE simulators.
Models are specified in the BioNetGen Langauge, providing a powerful model
building environment.

If you just want to download and use NFsim, you should simply download a
preconfigured packaged release from http://emonet.biology.yale.edu/nfsim. If
you want to hack on the code or make contributions, please create a fork and
submit pull requests to the dev branch.

## Building NFsim

### Linux and OSX

Make sure you have a recent version of CMake installed and run the following at
a terminal:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

### Windows

Make sure you have a recent version of CMake, Cygwin (or MinGW), and Ninja
installed. Then run the following at a terminal:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Ninja"
    ninja

### Optional: ExprTk Expression Parser

By default, NFsim uses muParser for mathematical expression parsing. You can
optionally build with ExprTk instead, which is a header-only, actively
maintained alternative. To enable ExprTk:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DNFSIM_USE_EXPRTK=ON ..
    make

**Note:** ExprTk requires C++17, while the default muParser build uses C++11.

**Why ExprTk?**
- Header-only (no external dependencies)
- Actively maintained (muParser development ceased ~2016)
- Faster expression evaluation
- Future-proof against compiler evolution

### Optional: Build NFsim as a Library

By default, NFsim builds only the `NFsim` command-line executable. You can also
build a reusable `nfsim` library target from the same source tree:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DNFSIM_BUILD_LIBRARY=ON ..
    make

To build only the library and skip the CLI executable:

    cmake -DNFSIM_BUILD_LIBRARY=ON -DNFSIM_BUILD_EXECUTABLE=OFF ..

To request a shared library instead of the default static library, also set:

    cmake -DNFSIM_BUILD_LIBRARY=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..

The `NFSIM_USE_EXPRTK` option works with either the executable or library
targets.

If you've built it with Cygwin and you want to move or package up the
executable, you'll need to copy the the following DLLs along with it:

* cygwin1.dll
* cygstdc++-6.dll
* cygz.dll
* cyggcc_s-seh-1.dll.

## Practical Flags

- `-gml <integer>` sets the per-molecule-type maximum agent count.
- `-gml auto` (also accepts `none` and `nolimit`) disables this cap. This is
    useful for very large models where the default cap would stop the simulation.

## TFUN Support

NFsim accepts TFUN functions in the XML it consumes from BioNetGen-style
workflows. Current BioNetGen lowercase `tfun()` emits `<Function type="TFUN"
...>` XML, and NFsim supports that XML contract directly.

Supported TFUN XML forms:

- file-backed: `<Function type="TFUN" file="..." ctrName="..." method="linear|step">`
- inline: `<Function type="TFUN" mode="inline" ctrName="..." xData="..." yData="..." method="linear|step">`

Supported TFUN counters:

- `time` or `t`
- a model parameter
- an observable
- another global function

Supported TFUN expression placeholders:

- current BioNetGen-compatible placeholder: `__TFUN_VAL__`
- legacy placeholder retained for compatibility: `__TFUN__VAL__`

Compatibility notes:

- `linear` matches current BioNetGen lowercase `tfun()` output.
- `step` remains supported for older TFUN workflows.
- If the legacy placeholder `__TFUN__VAL__` is used without an explicit
  `method`, NFsim preserves the older default of `step`.
- TFUN values may appear inside larger expressions such as
  `(__TFUN_VAL__+5)/k_scale`.

This section describes the XML contract NFsim accepts. NFsim itself is not a
BNGL parser; BioNetGen remains responsible for translating `tfun()` or older
`TFUN()` syntax into XML or other NFsim inputs.

## Python Scripting Helper

For easier Python integration, a lightweight helper is provided at
`tools/python/nfsim_api.py`.

Example:

```python
from tools.python import run_nfsim, read_gdat

result = run_nfsim("path/to/model.xml", extra_args=["-sim", "100", "-oSteps", "100"])
rows = read_gdat(result.output_path)
print(rows[0])
```

## Release Notes

### v1.14.3 April, 2025

Changed compilation flags for MacOS to produce universal binary the runs on both arm64 and intel macs.

### v1.14.2 May, 2024

(a) Bugfix: Fixed a segmentation fault resulting from having a species start with zero concentration. Two simple models were added to the validation process to catch this error.
(b) Changes to the validation process were made. Previously, 15 trajectories would be generated for each model before testing the differences of NFsim and SSA versus NFsim and ODE. Now only one trajectory would be tested and more would generate upon faliure until a model failed 15 times in a row.

### v1.14.1 May, 2023

(a) Bugfix: Added a missing "\[" when no operations are present

### v1.14.0 February, 2023

Relabeling the version number to follow previous scheme to avoid further confusion. 

(a) Feature: New output format, `.nfevent.json`. JSON based format for all events that happen during a NFsim simulation. This format replaces the older reaction format and can be used with the `-rxnlog` command line argument. The use of `.nfevent.json` file extension is highly recommended since a JSON schema for the format is available. 
(b) Bugfix: Fixed an issue where `-connect` option would break with models that have remove operations.

### v1.2.2 April, 2022

(a) Bugfix: Disabled maxcputime option
(b) Bugfix: NFsim now checks for compartments and quits if it finds a compartments block
(c) Bugifx: Leftover debug statement was removed.

### v1.2.1 Feb, 2022

(a) Bugfix release. An accidentally leftover debug statement was removed.

### v1.2.0 Jan, 2022

(a) Added the original file-backed TFUN support, which can pull values from a file given a counter observable in a model.
(b) A new option is added to infer connectivity between reaction rules. This option allows the user to infer "connected" rules before a model is ran and each time a rule fires, only connected rules are checked for updates, instead of every possible rule in the system.

### v1.12.1 Aug, 2016

(a) Bugfix release. Addresses an error dealing with local function and species
labels. The error dealt with the way mappingSets where created and passed to
the localFunction evaluation. A test case (v19.bngl) was added that addresses
this case.

### v1.12   Dec, 2015

(a) Changes to how molecule instances are mapped to BasicRxn's
(BasicRxnClass::tryToAdd()). It was possible for certain kinds of rules that
the mappingSets were not updated correctly because the head molecule matched a
reactant pattern before and after a reaction event BUT the mapping was
different after the firing. In such cases, the mappingSet was not updated
properly. The logic was changed to fix this problem. (b) Further changes to
how molecule instances are mapped to a ReactionClass object (BasicRxn and
DORReactions). In particular it is often the case that graph symmetry leads to
a complex being able to map to a ReactionClass multiple times. Symmetry
considerations were being made on the reaction center but not on the context
components which led to an undercounting of the number of times a pattern agent
could match a rule instance in some edge cases (see v17.bngl in the validation
suite). This led to incorrect results or even NFSim crashes. NOTE: the changes
made in points (a) and (b) may cause some models to execute less efficiently.
(c) Fixed index bound checking in MoleculeType::getComponentStateName(). (d)
Updated the validation models to reflect current BNGL formatting standards.
Added a few new validation models that address the bugfixes included in this
version. This update also includes a Python version of the validation script.

### v1.11   Oct, 2012

(a) Molecules without components may be treated as population variables
rather than individual agents. This feature is useful for reducing memory
requirements when a simple molecule has very large population. A molecule
type may be flagged for treatment as a population variable by using the
"population" keyword following the molecule type definition in the BNGL
model file. See section 8.i in the documentation for further detail.
(b) Added a new Reaction Class called "FunctionProduct" that permits local
functions defined on two reactants. The local rate law must have the form
f(x)\*g(y), where x and y are tags on two distinct reactants. See section
7.c in the documentation for complete information.
(c) Fixed some problems evaluating complex-scoped local functions (CSLF). 
CSLF were not updated properly after reactions that split complexes or 
deleted molecules. As in v1.10, complex-scoped local functions are
enabled by default. A new command-line switch, -nocslf, has been added
which disables complex-scoped evaluation. 
(d) Improved efficiency for matching patterns with connected-to syntax
when the connected-to component does not have reaction center. This may
be especially notable in models with large complexes, e.g. polymerization.
		
### v1.10   Aug, 2011
        
(a) Command line parser now detects arguments that are not properly preceeded
by a dash, and generates a warning. (b) Includes a check when creating
template molecules that throws an error when users attempt to use Null or Trash
in reactant or observable patterns (anything that requires the creation of a
Template molecule). (c) fixed a bug introduced in v1.09 whereby a site was
allowed to bind to itself, for instance, in a dimerization rxn. (d) Support
for creating a new molecule bound to an existing molecule, as in a rule like
A(a) -> A(a!1).A(a!1). Existing code that implemented this feature did not
function properly with the check for null conditions before reactions were
fired. (e) Fixed bug in template molecule when clearing molecules after a
connected-to syntax search. In some cases, not all molecules were being
cleared, giving rise to situations where adding one observable created dangling
matches which affected the results of other observables. (f) NFsim is now
packaged with Network3, an updated version of the run\_network code to execute
ODE and SSA simulations. Network3 allows global functions in BNGL models among
other release features given here:
http://bionetgen.org/index.php/Release\_Notes. Note that Network3 does not
support On-The-Fly Stochastic Simulation (you will have to recompile Network2
to use this feature). (g)  Mac 32bit is no longer supported by NFsim, but you
can make executables for older Macs by recompiling the code on your own
machine. See the manual for instructions.

### v1.09   Apr, 2011

(a) NFsim now allows the mixing of integers and strings as component labels,
although if numbers and strings are mixed, all labels are parsed as strings,
NOT integers. Therefore, PLUS and MINUS keywords cannot be used if mixing
integer states and string states, and a warning will be generated if a state is
set to PLUS. One can only use PLUS or MINUS when ALL states are an integer
value greater than zero. This new behavior was needed to handle BNGL files that
used the convention of ~P specifying phosphorylated, and ~0 specifying
unphosphorylated.  (b) Fixed bug whereby if verbose option was turned on
without specifying an output file location, no output would be generated. Now,
output to a gdat file will be generated in these cases.  (c) Use of 'ss' input
argument to 'saveSpecies', which prints a a list of all species at the end of a
simulation, is now handled. This feature was implemented to allow future
support in BNG by restarting an NFsim simulation after it ends, which can be
done by parsing the output species list together with a BNGL model file. This
feature still has to be tested in BNG, and will likely be fully documented in
v1.10. The 'ss' flag writes the file to either system_name_nf.species, or a
file designated by the user.  (d) fixed memory leak in TemplateMolecules that
caused memory / performance issues with molecules having multiple identical
sites and a high degree of aggregation. (e) fixed csv error, where when the csv
flag is used, the header line is not comma delimited. (f)  nfsim now supports
intra-molecular binding. Previously these events were rejected as null events.

### v1.08 Dec, 2010

With the new TotalRate keyword, users are now able to specify whether or not to
use the microscopic (default) interpretation or macroscopic (TotalRate)
interpretation of rate laws. Now, NFsim convention matches BNG. Previously,
NFsim interpreted all rates as microscopic except for global functions, which
were interpreted as macroscopic. This is now also explained in the user manual.
Example models for the flagellar motor and oscillating gene expression have
been updated correspondingly so that they still produce the same results as in
the NFsim paper.

Users also now have the option of outputting gdat files in a comma delimited
format (csv), which makes parsing the output file easier in some circumstances,
using the flag "-csv". Additionally, a bug in the parameter scanning script was
fixed that caused the script to crash when scanning a model that includes the
local function syntax. 

### v1.07   Nov, 2010

A series of updates to the code were made in this release. (1) RNF files that
are not found produce an error message. Previously, no error message was given
and execution proceeded as if the RNF flag was not given. (2) Input flags to
NFsim can be given in the original format with a single dash (as in ./NFsim
-logo), or with the more "linuxy" style double dash (as in ./NFsim --logo).
(3) The parameter scan script had problems when parsing BNGL files with local
functions due to the '%' character. This is now fixed. (4) The universal
traversal limit is automatically set to be the size of the largest pattern in
the system, which can be overridden by passing the -utl flag. This allows
users who are unfamiliar with this speedup to still take advantage of it to a
certain extent. (5) the -rtag flag was added that allows NFsim to produce
output whenever a particular reaction, given by the -rtag flag, is given. This
allows, for instance, users to track the fates of single particles exactly
without using the comprehensive molecule output feature. (6) The above changes
are documented in an updated user manual.

### v1.06   Sept 28, 2010

Added scripts for running NFsim from Matlab, parameter scanning, and basic
parameter estimation. The manual is also updated to reflect these changes.
However, the precompiled executables of NFsim remain unchanged from v1.05, so
running them will give the old version number unless you recompile the code on
your own computer. Also, models that were used to compare the performance of
NFsim to DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey, and Kappa are now included with a readme file
under: models/performance\_test\_models.

### v1.052  

First publicly released stable build
